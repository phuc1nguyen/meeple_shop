        <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
        <p>Meepleshop is not responsible for lost or stolen items. For lost items we will work with the shipper to get the items replaced at no cost to you; if the item cannot be replaced a refund will be given.</p>
        <p>Meepleshop offers several shipping options. In the continental US, our shipping price for purchases under $80 is $5.99 and free shipping over $80. Hawaii and Alaska orders do not receive free shipping. Once an order is placed we will contact the customer with a shipping quote.  We ship orders using either UPS Ground, UPS Surepost, or USPS. The time in transit varies by carrier but it typically ranges from 2-5 days. </p>
        <p>Meepleshop many times lists products for sale that are in-stock at a distributor. Please expect a 3 - 4 business day delay as the games are shipped to Meepleshop and then re-shipped to you. This starts the next business day after the order was placed. Customers purchasing locally for in-store pick-up will be notified via e-mail when the item is ready for pick-up.</p>
