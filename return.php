        <h1>Return Policy</h1>

        <br>
        <h3>Returns</h3>
        <p>Items may only be returned within 7 days of receipt. Meepleshop does not cover shipping costs on returns. We recommend that you insure your shipment. You will not be reimbursed for an item that Meepleshop does not receive. If items arrive back to Meepleshop damaged, an additional fee will be deducted for the damage.</p>
        <p>All returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee. The restocking fee is waived if store credit is elected as the refund method.* We do not refund the shipping paid on an item if the item is being returned.</p>
        <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition as it was when purchased. It must also be in the original packaging, including shrink-wrap. Meepleshop will not accept returns on used games or games that have been opened.</p>
        <p>If Meepleshop has already given notification of the order being shipped, then the order cannot be cancelled/refunded. You will have to wait to receive the item and then ship it back to Meepleshop for a return.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Orders cancellation</h3>
        <p>If you would like to cancel an order, please email customerservice@meepleshop.test to request a cancellation. Please note that cancelled orders are subject to the 15% restocking fee which is waived if store credit is elected as the refund method. If Meepleshop has already given notification of the order being shipped, then the order cannot be cancelled. You will have to wait to receive the item and then ship it back to Meepleshop as a return.</p>
        <p>If you call the physical store to cancel an order, the employee can assist with any questions you may have but the cancellation request will still have to go through customerservice@meepleshop.test. They will not be able to cancel an order for you over the phone.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Please note that due to processing times, we can not guarantee cancellation of an order as it may already be processed and shipping.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refunds may be issued as store credit or in the form of the original payment method. In order to determine the method of credit, Meepleshop will need to see a copy of the sales receipt (such as viewing the emailed receipt). If unavailable, Meepleshop may be able to look up the original transaction via their internal system.</p>
        <p>If a customer requests a refund on an unfulfilled order after 6 months of the purchased date and Paypal was used as the method of payment, the amount will be refunded via store credit.</p>
        <p>Several types of goods may not be returned. Perishable goods such as food cannot be returned. Additional non-refundable items include, but are not limited to, gift cards, newspapers, magazines, and downloadable software products. Items marked “as is” or “final sale” are non-refundable.</p>
        <p><b>All cancelled orders or items, of any type, are subject to a 15% restocking fee.</b></p>

        <br>
        <h3>Damage Policy</h3>
        <p>Damage must be reported within 7 days of delivery and pictures of the shipping box and damaged item(s) must be sent to Customer Service. We will examine the photos and either send a replacement game(s) or issue a small credit to account for the damage. If a return is desired please read over the return policy as it would apply.</p>
        <p><b>In the event your games arrive to you damaged please keep the shipping box and all packing materials until your claim is resolved. Please be prepared to send pictures of the damage to your games as well as pictures capturing all side of the box including the bottom and the shipping label.</b></p>
        <p>Please note, damage to plastic clamshells or shrink wrap are not considered damage.</p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT remove shrink wrap</span> if your game is damaged. If you open the product, we are unable to replace the item. </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Pre-Order Policy</h3>
        <p>Meeple_shop.test uses a number of distributors instead of relying on a single distributor to get product on time. We will always attempt to fill each and every order. For reasons beyond our control delays, augmentations, or cancellations may be necessary.</p>
        <p>In situations where manufacturers release product in waves or partial quantities we start our shipping process at the oldest pre-orders first.</p>
        <p>All preorders require full payment at the time the preorder is placed. We reserve the right to cancel any orders for any reason at any time. If we need to cancel an order we will email the customer, but are under no obligation to obtain permission or acknowledgement, prior to cancellation.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change our prices at any time. Sets, and other products that we assemble, do not have a guaranteed preorder/back order price. If a price increase occurs we will notify you via email. If we do not receive a response we will cancel your order, refunding the full amount paid.</p>
